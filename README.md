# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** Variable (~150 to 500 characters, paragraph-based)  
**Overlap:** 0 characters

The starter chunker used a fixed 800-character window with a 120-character overlap. In the `city_guides` corpus, this arbitrary slicing split distinct advice sections in half, cutting sentences across boundaries and mixing unrelated tips into the same chunk. 

I replaced this in `chunker.py::split_documents` by splitting on double newlines (`\n\n`) and filtering fragments under 40 characters. Because the source Markdown guides are already organized into focused, standalone paragraphs, paragraph-level chunking ensures that each indexed chunk represents a complete semantic thought without dragging in unrelated neighboring context.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```Getting around the region with limited mobility
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#3 ` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```One pub in the largest village serves food seven days a week. A second, in the third village, opens Thursday to Sunday. There is a farm shop at the valley mouth that sells bread, cheese and little else, and it closes at 4pm. Bring supplies; this is not a place with options.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#3 ` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour ground twenty metres away and is the reason most people come. One pub, food served lunchtimes and Thursday to Saturday evenings.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_marchwood.md#2` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```A tram network of four lines, running every 8 minutes on weekdays and every 15 at weekends, until midnight. A day ticket costs less than two single fares and nobody tells you this at the machine. The centre is walkable but the interesting districts are not adjacent to each other.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_seasons.md#1 ` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```The Kestrelford Saturday market builds back to full size through April.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
What are the best food spots around here?
**Answer:**

```Based on the provided documents, good food can generally be found one street back from the main visitor areas (such as Corry Lane in Brightwater, Marine Terrace in Pellew Sands, and Halden Bay's harbour front). Specific local highlights include:

Halden Bay's two harbour restaurants for fresh seafood.

Givens Mill's tearoom for bread made from locally ground flour.

Kestrelford's bakery, which sells out by 11am and brings many people back.

Thornby Wells for Sunday lunch (which requires booking a week ahead).

(Sources: guide_eating.md, guide_pellew_sands.md, guide_kestrelford.md)
```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.60

In-corpus queries scored distances between ~0.48 and ~0.56, while out-of-scope queries scored above 0.70. Setting the cutoff at 0.60 cleanly accepts relevant city queries while rejecting campus-related or off-topic prompts before calling the model.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| By what time does the bakery in Kestrelford typically sell out? | Yes | 0.491 |
| Where can you find fresh seafood restaurants in Halden Bay? | Yes | 0.523 |
| What is special about the bread served at the tearoom in Givens Mill? | Yes | 0.485 |
| How far in advance do you need to book Sunday lunch in Thornby Wells? | Yes | 0.531 |
| Which street in Brightwater is known for food away from the main visitor areas? | Yes | 0.565 |
| What is the policy on bringing pets to dorms? | No | 0.742 |
| How do I add or drop a computer science course during syllabus week? | No | 0.781 |
| Where can I buy a replacement student parking permit? | No | 0.715 |
| What are the operating hours for the campus recreation center pool? | No | 0.739 |
| Who do I contact about a broken microwave in the communal kitchen? | No | 0.763 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?
